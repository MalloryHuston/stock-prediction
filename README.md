# Stock Price Predictor
This algorithm predicts different stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network in Python using TensorFlow 2 and Keras.

To run this:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
- Edit `parameters.py` for your needs and run `train.py`. This will start training using the parameters you specified.
- Once you trained your model, use `test.py` to evaluate and test your model.
